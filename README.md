# Assignment 3: Webscraping (plus some extras)

This repository contains starter code for your third assignment, which is about honing your (non-API) webscraping skills. I've also thrown in some extra questions to test your basic regression modeling and mapping skills.

The goal of the assignment is download and analyse 100m sprint data. While we covered a virtually identical topic during lectures, the structure of the data source used here is markedly different. Don't worry, though; I'll walk you through the assignment with explicit hints. 

The structure of the newly-cloned repository is as follows:

```
repo
|
-- README.md
|
-- .gitignore
|
-- R
   |
   -- 100m.Rmd

```

You should clone this repo using the RStudio Project method that we practiced in class. Then, I want you to open up the `R/100m.Rmd` file where you will find the questions and basic template for providing your answers. You should answer each question by inserting R code chunks (like we practiced in class) in the relevant spaces. Whenever you "knit" this `R/100m.Rmd` file, you will produce the corresponding `R/100m.md` (i.e. Markdown) and `R/100m.html` (i.e. HTML) files, as well as some auxiliary folders. Don't worry about those now; they are just to help speed things up and my template should take care of everything for you.

Last things: Please pay attention when I ask you to comment on your results in addition to coding them up. **And please mark your comment answers in bold so that I can easily identify them.**
